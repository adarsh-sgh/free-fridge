Our web application is the solution to a major problem that had to be solved a long time ago. The deficit and excess of food can be solved through this idea of food sharing.Those who can afford can donate the remaining food to those who are starving and thus the normal balance of things is restored.In vain we try to make applications for education, school platforms or other things, if people die of hunger and the only society that will remain standing is the aristocratic one. We need a change because it is not normal to throw away so much food that can actually be used.Thus, because we want to give a chance to the life of every human being, we want to find a way of reconciliation for all, we hope for a better world for a wise world that realizes that excess food only causes a natural imbalance and in a few decades the food and water will be just a dream, we believe that this web application will have a important positive impact on humanity.
