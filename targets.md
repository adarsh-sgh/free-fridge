Protons
Some of the features can be:
OVERALL WEBPAGE
1. The background of the webpage should be very much emotional and
sensitive related to hunger.(can be dark wallpaper for more emphasis)
2. Statistical data of how many people die every year of hunger should be
clearly indicated.
3. It should also include the no. of needy people benefitted from this
platform plus the recent contributors.
4. The form should be filled in by the donor.
5. City should be asked first.
6. People who are already contributing to feed the poor from that state can
be displayed as an example.
7. Somewhere, the names of all the NGOs registered with us along with their
details should be mentioned(not on the homepage but somewhere inside
a link)
8.
AND MANY MORE SUCH POINTS …..
FORM
1. should take inputs like Name, mob no.,email address, event Address (can
be text and/or google map location pin/automatically fetch user’s GPS
location), approx. no. of people who can be fed with it., Pickup latest by
<time>
2. a unique form no. may/may not be generated.
3. Registered NGOs of that city may get a notification and contributor's
details by email and/or SMS
4. After submitting the form by the user, the user should see some sort of
quotes that make him feel he has done great job.
OPTIONAL
1. A map to show all the nearby places where there’s excess food left
after the event is over.
2. If there’s no NGO registered with us in that city, ask user if individual
person can takeaway food from the event or not. If yes, then the
nearby people(xD) can take advantage of it to make sure no food is
wasted. Lol.
3. We may give out certificates to the people who donate food through
this platform. This feature can be neglected or it can be added if
there’s much time left before the hackathon. It will incude coding to
use the form details to make certificate.
